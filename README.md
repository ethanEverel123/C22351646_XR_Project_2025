# C22351646_XR_Project_2025
This is my repository for my XR project for my studies :]
My idea for this project is to make a river cleaning game

This addresses SDG goal 6 Clean Water & Sanitation as it will make the user more aware of the trash affecting our water and environment
This would probably be standalone from QuestSDG unless a mini game section is added


THE GOALS/key features
- Pick trash out of the river and put it into the correct bin
- DON'T PICK OUT THE FISH!(they can't breath air)
- Sort trash to gain points and spend them for upgrades before the time runs out!
- After each game it displays a fact about river sanitation

The player will move their controller and pick trash out of the river and put it into the correct bin to gain points.
This trash will flow by on a moving river in front of the player so they will have to be quick and dexterous.
The player has to be careful not to take out a fish as they will lose points, could add a pufferfish that makes the player experience a trippy visual effect.
If the player collects a clock they could get a time bonus and a score multiplier.
The player can spend their points at a shop, they could buy an extendo-arm for greater reach, a magnifying glass to highlight the fish or cosmetics for their hands.

I will use the tools of the virtual environment
