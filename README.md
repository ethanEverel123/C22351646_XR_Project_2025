# Description of the project
The project didn't live up to the initial goals, the user is able to pick up the fish and trash from the river but no points are gained, it does display facts like I wanted and scold the user for putting fish in the bin.

# Instructions for use
Copy the project to local and run as a Godot XR project, I used the oculus quest 2 so other devices could present issues.


# how it works:
The trash and fish are randomly spawned in at a marker3d, this then puts them in the river which is an area 3d node that applied a forward and upwards force to their rigid bodies

#What am I most proud of
I am most proud of the river, it is a very simple way to make a river in Godot, I had spent a lot of time researching how to make rivers in Godot and they all pointed me to complicated libraries that generate realistic rivers but I am proud of the simplicity of my river.

#what I learned
I learnt a lot about working in XR and the way you should develop it. For the river I tried to develop it independently of the XR tool kit and run it as a 3d scene, this sped up development time as I didn't have to wait for the XR export to the quest 2, I would do this again in a future project but I would be more aware of using XR pickable assets rather than just rigidbody3ds 

# proposal submitted earlier
This is my repository for my XR project for my studies :]
My idea for this project is to make a river cleaning game

This addresses SDG goal 6 Clean Water & Sanitation as it will make the user more aware of the trash affecting our water and environment
This would probably be standalone from QuestSDG unless a mini game section is added


THE GOALS/key features
- Pick trash out of the river and put it into the correct bin
- DON'T PICK OUT THE FISH!(they can't breath air)
- Sort trash to gain points and spend them for upgrades before the time runs out!
- After each game it displays a fact about river sanitation

The player will move their controller and pick trash out of the river and put it into the correct bin to gain points.
This trash will flow by on a moving river in front of the player so they will have to be quick and dexterous.
The player has to be careful not to take out a fish as they will lose points, could add a pufferfish that makes the player experience a trippy visual effect.
If the player collects a clock they could get a time bonus and a score multiplier.
The player can spend their points at a shop, they could buy an extendo-arm for greater reach, a magnifying glass to highlight the fish or cosmetics for their hands.

I will use the tools of the virtual environment
